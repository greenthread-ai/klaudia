# Changelog

Notable changes to Klaudia. The version tracks the Claude Code reference the Go
port mirrors (see `internal/version`).

## Unreleased

### Added
- **Prompt caching (Anthropic).** Requests now set `cache_control` breakpoints on
  the stable prefix (tools + system prompt) and a rolling conversation
  breakpoint, so each turn no longer re-pays full price for the whole history.
  Because the system prompt and tools are byte-stable across launches, this also
  caches across `--continue`/resume (verified live: the resumed turn reads the
  whole prior prefix from cache rather than re-creating it). Cache usage is
  reported in the result envelope (`cache_read_input_tokens` /
  `cache_creation_input_tokens`). Disable with `KLAUDIA_DISABLE_PROMPT_CACHE`.

### Fixed
- **Tool order is now stable.** `Registry.Names()` iterated a map, so the tool
  list (and thus the request's cached prefix) was shuffled every turn — which by
  itself defeated prompt caching. Names are now sorted; verified live to take
  cache reads from 0 to most of the prefix.
- **Streaming no longer hangs forever.** A stalled model stream (half-open SSE
  connection) used to leave the TUI stuck on "thinking…". An idle watchdog now
  breaks a stalled turn — transparently retrying when nothing has been emitted
  yet, otherwise failing with a clear timeout. Configurable via
  `KLAUDIA_STREAM_IDLE_TIMEOUT` (seconds, default 120; `0` disables). Covers both
  the Anthropic and OpenAI-compatible providers.
- **Long-context-credits 429** now reports honestly: the *"Usage credits are
  required for long context requests"* error is a billing gate, so the message no
  longer suggests retrying — it points at adding credits or reducing context.
- **Session resume "lost memory".** Auto-resume could land on an empty transcript
  left by a launch that recorded nothing (quit before typing, or every turn
  errored on an expired token), reporting "resumed" with no context. `MostRecent`
  now skips contentless transcripts, and transcripts are created lazily on first
  write so aborted launches leave no file behind.
- **Markdown files rendered as soup.** Reading a `.md` file in the TUI ran its
  `cat -n` output through the Markdown renderer, collapsing every line into one
  reflowed block with inlined line numbers. Line-numbered tool output is now
  shown verbatim.

### Changed
- Docs: corrected the prompt-caching status in `docs/parity.md` (planned, not
  implemented) and documented the streaming/reliability knobs in the README.
